### Reflection
- Since the HTML and CSS were provided to start working on the project it let us see how JS works together with those elements.
- Because the project asked us to interact with the HTML and CSS in a variety of ways, it was a good learning experience about what JS can and can’t do on its own in creating a webpage.
- The most challenging part of the project was finding pure JS solutions to selecting the correct part of the page and applying the listeners we wanted.
- Multiple times in the project, adding an additional class or ID to an HTML element could have helped us reuse the functions. However, this added layer of challenge also forced us to become more familiar with JS.

### Future Features
- All buttons change color when clicked (not solely hover color change)
- Replace parts of the poster with a new random image, title or quote by clicking on them
- Drag and drop saved posters in the grid to new positions
- When a saved poster is clicked in the grid, two buttons pop up to let user choose between deleting the poster and promoting it as the main poster
